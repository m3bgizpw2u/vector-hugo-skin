## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffolding: theme directory structure, example site fixtures, dev tooling
  (npm + Playwright + ESLint + Stylelint + TypeScript configs), and Cursor rule set —
  see `.plans/first-plan/00-environment-setup.md` and `04-repo-directory-structure.md`.
- Phase 1 research notes (`docs/RESEARCH.md`): catalog of what to keep and what to exclude
  from Wikipedia's Vector 2022 skin, plus the upstream LESS → SCSS and ES6 → TS source
  mappings and the candidate `theme.toml` parameter surface. The Vector source clone at
  `reference/vector/` is gitignored — kept locally for ongoing reference, never committed.
  See `.plans/first-plan/01-research-vector-skin.md` and `14-licensing-and-scope-notes.md`.
- Phase 2 research notes (`docs/RESEARCH.md` §6 + §7): structural study of MediaWiki's
  `Template:Infobox` metatemplate and four topic children (person, company, software,
  settlement) in original analysis words — no verbatim Wikipedia template code or
  parameter tables reproduced — plus the four locked-in design decisions for the v1
  shortcode family (family of named wrappers with shared base partial + inner-primitive
  escape hatch; v1 field set including the `infobox-pair-*` special-case primitives;
  right-floated on desktop / full-width stacked below the lead on mobile; explicit v1
  scope cuts for geo-map widgets, embedded charts, collapsible sub-tables, Wikidata
  lookups, Lua/Scribunto, and Wikipedia microformat emission). §7 reproduces the
  top-30 coverage contract from `.plans/first-plan/2a-infobox-template-inventory.md`
  for downstream phases to reference; the Phase 2½ executor will re-verify and may
  re-rank before Phase 8 begins. See `.plans/first-plan/02-research-infobox-templates.md`
  and `14-licensing-and-scope-notes.md` §3 for the licensing boundary around this
  work (study structure and parameter concepts only — never copy template code).
